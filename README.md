##Overview
For your first project you will be creating a trivia game. The topic of the trivia can be whatever you like, you will be creating custom questions using a Headless CMS.

Minimum Viable Product
Create a question model with a Headless CMS (Either Contentful or Agility CMS) and create at least 20 questions
(Use this video playlist a guide on how to use Contentful , try out figuring Agility CMS on your own if you want an extra challenge.)

Pull those questions into your website using an AJAX call (will need to read the documentation for the Headless CMS)
Create a Two player game where players can alternate turns and track their score
Mobile-First Design (Media Queries, Flex-Box, and Grid should help you achieve this)
Readme Documentation on your project
